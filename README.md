# belaysound

This system uses a microphone mounted on the back of a climbing wall to detect if a climber is clipped in to the auto belay or not while they are climbing.
We provide lane detection and clip detection features.

This is a simple proof-of-concept for a class project.
For more details, read the [paper](BelaySound.pdf).
